# SignalOS

SignalOS is a personal intelligence system that collects high-signal AI, technology, business, and education news, filters and ranks it using GPT, and turns it into four actionable daily signals.

The signals are delivered through Discord and displayed in a FastAPI dashboard with feedback controls, persistent article history, and weekly intelligence reports.

The goal is not to create another generic news summariser. SignalOS is designed for student-builders, programmers, and early-stage founders who need to know which developments actually matter for their projects, skills, and opportunities.

## What it does

SignalOS runs automatically in the cloud and performs the full pipeline:

```text
RSS feeds
→ article normalisation
→ freshness filtering
→ deduplication
→ source-balanced candidate selection
→ GPT strategic ranking
→ four actionable signals
→ Discord delivery
→ FastAPI dashboard
→ feedback and weekly intelligence
```

## Current features

- Fetches articles from selected AI, technology, business, and education RSS feeds
- Filters stale articles and previously seen stories
- Deduplicates articles using stable fingerprints and normalised metadata
- Applies source-balanced candidate preselection
- Caps ranking input to control API cost
- Uses GPT to rank articles by relevance, quality, importance, and actionability
- Maps model-returned indexes back to original trusted article objects
- Produces four daily strategic signals
- Generates reasons and concrete action takeaways
- Delivers signals through Discord
- Displays intelligence in a FastAPI dashboard
- Stores article feedback
- Generates weekly intelligence reports
- Uses atomic JSON writes, locking, backups, and corruption detection
- Runs daily and weekly workflows with GitHub Actions
- Includes a deterministic no-secrets Demo Mode for reviewers

## How it works

### 1. Article collection

SignalOS fetches recent articles from a curated set of RSS feeds focused on AI and technology.

### 2. Freshness filtering

Articles are filtered so the digest prefers genuinely recent stories instead of old RSS items that remain near the top of a feed.

### 3. Repeat prevention

Each selected article is converted into a stable fingerprint based on its title and URL. SignalOS stores those fingerprints in a lightweight state file so the same story is not repeatedly sent across different days.

### 4. AI ranking

Candidate articles are passed to an OpenAI model, which ranks them using:

- Relevance to the user profile
- Article quality
- Strategic importance
- Practical actionability

### 5. Digest generation

The selected articles are formatted into a Markdown digest with reasoning and action takeaways.

### 6. Discord delivery

The digest is sent to Discord using a webhook. Long digests are split into multiple Discord-safe chunks instead of being silently cut off.

## Demo Mode

Demo Mode gives reviewers and OpenAI Build Week judges a deterministic SignalOS dashboard without requiring API keys, Discord credentials, RSS fetching, or paid model calls. It uses clearly synthetic sample articles, feedback, and a weekly report; it does not run the daily pipeline.

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 scripts/load_demo_data.py
uvicorn src.web_app:app --reload
```

Then open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in a browser. The dashboard will show four demo signals, two existing ratings, two unrated signals for testing the feedback controls, and a weekly intelligence report.

The loader refuses to overwrite existing runtime files. To intentionally replace them with the synthetic fixtures, run:

```bash
python3 scripts/load_demo_data.py --force
```

Demo Mode makes no network or API calls, needs no secrets, and is intended only as a safe reviewer experience.

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/on9kitkit/SignalOS.git
cd SignalOS
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Create a `.env` file

Copy the example file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then add your own values:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=your_discord_webhook_url_here
```

Never commit `.env` to GitHub.

### 5. Run locally

```bash
python -m src.main
```

If everything is configured correctly, SignalOS will print the digest locally and send it to Discord.

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

## GitHub Actions automation

SignalOS is designed to run automatically through GitHub Actions.

The workflow:

- Checks out the repository
- Installs Python dependencies
- Restores seen-article history from cache
- Runs the agent
- Sends the digest to Discord
- Saves updated seen-article history for future runs

Required GitHub Secrets:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY
DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
```

## Security notes

This repository should not contain secrets. API keys and webhooks are loaded from environment variables or GitHub Secrets.

Ignored local files include:

```text
.env
.venv/
__pycache__/
digests/
.signalos_state/
```

## OpenAI Build Week development

SignalOS existed before OpenAI Build Week as an early command-line and Discord intelligence prototype.

During Build Week, it was meaningfully extended with:

- a FastAPI intelligence dashboard
- weekly intelligence reports
- persistent article feedback
- progressive-enhancement JavaScript interactions
- source-balanced candidate preselection
- ranking token and cost controls
- configurable model selection
- GitHub Actions concurrency safeguards
- sanitised delivery failures
- atomic and locked JSON state storage
- a deterministic reviewer Demo Mode
- repository-wide security and reliability auditing with Codex

The dated Git history and Codex sessions document these additions.

## Roadmap

Planned upgrades:

- Use explicit feedback signals in future ranking
- Add editable and undoable feedback
- Add saved build ideas
- Add dashboard search and filtering
- Add trend detection across multiple weeks
- Add semantic article similarity
- Add authentication and database-backed multi-user storage
- Benchmark local inference workflows on Apple Silicon
- Turn SignalOS into a focused personal-intelligence SaaS

## Why this project exists

Most news feeds create noise. SignalOS is built to create leverage.

The long-term vision is a personalised intelligence system that helps ambitious builders notice important shifts early, connect them to their own projects, and convert information into action.
